Until recently I dismissed Epicureanism as just another brand of hedonism.
But I'm beginning to see that the Epicureans understood hedonism much better
than we do today.
On the surface, they present a contradiction: their basic tenet is that the
attainment of pleasure and avoidance of pain are the sole purpose of life.
And yet they warn against overindulgence:

> It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by
> sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious
> table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the
> grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which
> the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.
>
> \- Epicurus, _Letter to Menoeceus_

A bait and switch!
I was expecting _The Wolf of Wall Street_, but here Epicurus is telling me to go
live in a monastery.
Is he interested in maximizing pleasure or not?
Maybe the Epicureans were really just "closet Stoics" with a distaste for
superstition, and the whole pleasure thing was just a front.
But there's a better explanation, one that reveals a certain wisdom to Epicurean
thinking: that they _had_ learned how to maximize pleasure in their lives, and
(as usual), we're the fools.

Our naive understanding of pleasure is "monotonic": the more of X the better.
One easy consequences of this view is that _pleasure has no maximum_.
That if one piece of chocolate cake is good then two is better, and three even
better; that luxuriating in a hot tub for two hours is better than doing so for
only one hour; etc.

We all subconciously understand that this conventional understanding of pleasure
is deeply flawed.
But we generally fail to appreciate _why_, and doing so offers some suprising
insights.
The problem with the monotonic view is simply that the _second piece of
chocolate cake doesn't taste as good as the first_.
The cake might be identical in every regard, but our _experience_ of eating it
isn't a copy of the first.
And in order to make the experience identical you'd need to wipe your memory of
having eaten the first piece, in which case it wouldn't really _be_ a second
piece.
Our desire for a thing needs to be "recharged" before we can fully appreciate it
again.

This offers a very different view of pleasure, as something that _has a
maximum_.
This means that, at some point, having more of a thing is actually _less_
pleasurable than having _less_ of it.
The Epicureans appear to have cultivated a deep understanding of and
appreciation for this apparent contradiction.

One suprising consequence of this perspective is that we, in the 21st century,
may have already found ways to maximize pleasure in many realms.
That with a modest income, you can experience as much pleasure from, say, eating
as is humanly possible.
And that when we pine for the lives of wealthy celebrities, we're really asking
to be _less_ satisfied than we could be today: if the "most pleasurable dose" of
a thing is rather small and available to almost anyone, then having the ability
to acquire more is just a harmful temptation.

So under this model, maximizing pleasure requires _contemplation_ (_"it is sober
reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance"_).
Under the "monotonic" model this isn't necessary: you don't need to think, just
acquire more and more and more of a thing.
The Epicurean view requires us to ask, before reaching out for a thing, "do I
_really_ want this, or am I just _accustomed_ to wanting it?"
