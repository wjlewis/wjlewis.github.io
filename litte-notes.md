## Being Wrong, and Being Surprised

Topics like math and computing tend to be far removed from practical every day
concerns.
But studying them requires developing a very useful practical skill: familiarity
with being convinved that you're right, only to find out that you're dead wrong.

## Concepts, Categories, and Models

All models of the world are incomplete.
Actually, models are only useful _because_ they're incomplete.
A model that perfectly reproduced every aspect of reality would be a copy of
reality.

We ask too much of categories!
We demand definite boundaries and firm, "yes/no" answers.
There's tension between the simple boundary lines we can understand, and the
complex fractal-like nature of most interesting things.
Categorizing has the effect of simplifying reality in a cartoon world.
We should _use_ these cartoons to their full effect, but we shouldn't _believe_
in them.

## Incentives

Only a fool is surprised when people act according to incentives.
