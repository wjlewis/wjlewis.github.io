      <main><h1>The Joy of Scheming</h1>

<p>A few mornings ago I hacked together a <a href="https://github.com/wjlewis/pocket-scheme">basic Scheme system</a>
in JavaScript.
I needed an interpreter for another project I was working on and Scheme fit the
bill: simple to parse, simple to evaluate, yet incredibly expressive.</p>

<p>There’s a magical quality to writing compilers and interpreters.
Early in the process, programs in the target language just act and behave like
strings.
But there’s this turning point where these programs start <em>computing</em> things.
I’ve written lots of typecheckers and fragments of language-related programs
recently, but it had been some time since I’d built a system that worked
end-to-end like this one.
As a result, I’d forgotten the feeling of enchantment and pure joy of seeing
programs come alive in this way.</p>

<p>My first taste of Scheme had been in the fall of 2016.
I remember searching the internet for “best books to learn about recursion” or
something to that effect.
Two books were consistently recommended: <em>The Little Schemer</em> and <em>SICP</em>.
I bought a heavily-used copy of <em>The Little LISPer</em> (the first edition of <em>TLS</em>)
and was instantly hooked.
For the next several weeks, I thought about Scheme and recursion incessantly.
My notes for other classes were covered in s-expressions, and anyone who saw
them must’ve thought I’d lost my grip.</p>

<p>A few chapters into <em>The Little LISPer</em> I started working through <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html"><em>SICP</em></a>.
I was working at the front desk at our school’s gym, a job which consisted
mostly of standing in one place in front of a computer.
So in the evenings, once the flow of patrons slowed down to a trickle, I’d open
a browser tab and pick up wherever I’d left off.
I’d think about symbolic differentiation or continuations while switching the
towels from the washer to the dryer, or wiping down equipment.</p>

<p>There’s a quality to <em>The Little Schemer</em>, <em>SICP</em>, and Scheme itself that’s hard
to pin down.
Reading either of these books feels a bit like walking into a humble little
country restaurant, a couple of chefs in the back chopping squash and onions
they just pulled from the garden.
<em>How good could it possibly be?</em> you wonder, given the simple ingredients and
unimposing look of the place.
But the first bite dispels all doubt: under skillful hands, a few humble
vegetables have been transformed into the most delicious thing you’ve tasted in
years.
What’s more, after you’ve eaten, they invite you to the kitchen, hand you an
apron, and show you all they know.</p>
