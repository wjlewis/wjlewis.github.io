      <main><h1>Voting</h1>

<p>We misinterpret voting in the US.
We behave as if we’re electing <em>outcomes</em> rather than individuals, and this
could never be the case.
The world is a complicated place, and the future is clouded by uncertainty.</p>

<p>We treat elections as if they’re a choice between prosperity and doom.
That A being elected will mean cheaper housing, global peace, and better
education, whereas if B is elected the world will make another irreversible step
towards catastrophe.
So we find it galling when others throw in their lot with doom rather than vote
for prosperity.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t see things like this!
It’s absolute madness, and a little introspection and review of the last three
decades should be enough to convince us otherwise.
Every presidency during my lifetime has been characterized by unanticipated
global events like 9/11, the banking crisis, and the Covid19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In the months preceding the 2000 election, nobody was arguing about the question:
<em>to what extent will each candidate get mired in Afghanistan, should a group of
fundamentalists fly planes into American buildings?</em>
Why would they?
We can’t predict the future.
The decades of misery and instability that resulted from our attempt to fix the
Middle East is more significant than anything else the Bush administration did.
(And I’m not really blaming Bush, either.
Hard as it is to believe, it’s totally possible that things could be a lot worse
now, had he—or a different president in some counterfactual—made
different decisions.)</p>

<p>We see the act of voting as adding some weight to one side or the other of a
giant balance, with a bright future on one side and gloom on the other.
But it’s really like putting a marble into one slot or another of an
incomprehensible Rube Goldberg machine.
It’s possible that there would be <em>fewer</em> abortions under a pro-choice president
than a pro-life one: maybe the pro-choice president introduced social programs
that made having a baby seem like less of a death sentence to poor single
mothers than it did before.
Likewise it’s possible that we’d have less of a negative impact on the
environment under a president who doesn’t care about the planet at all: maybe
they <em>do</em> care a lot about innovation and new technology, and end up indirectly
funding a startup that produces super efficient batteries, or cracks some big
problem in fusion power generation, etc.
Same with issues related to immigration, foreign affairs, and anything else that
matters.</p>

<p>We don’t know whether the world will be a better or worse place under candidate
X or Y, so we shouldn’t get too upset when someone else makes a different
prediction.
After all, that’s all it is: a <em>prediction</em>.
Candidate X may have terrible intentions, speak badly about certain groups of
people, ignore large swathes of the country, etc, and yet <em>still</em> inadvertently
play a role in producing a better future for the people they care so little for.</p>

<p>So when Jones votes for the presidential equivalent of a cloud of mosquitoes,
maybe he’s onto something.
I don’t like mosquitoes, but maybe that’s what the system needs right now.
Likewise for when Alice votes for the equivalent of a wolf or a chimpanzee.</p>

<p>It’s a <strong>system</strong>, and voting is an opportunity to tinker with a small but
significant part of that system.
It is <em>not</em> an opportunity to dictate how that system behaves.</p>
