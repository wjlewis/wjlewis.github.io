      <main><h1>Wanting to Want</h1>

<p>I have a habit of going outside very underdressed during the winter.
And as a punishment I get asked, quite frequently, “Aren’t you cold?”
The simple answer is, usually, “Yes, and that’s okay!”</p>

<p>I <em>like</em> being cold!
At least a little bit cold, for a little bit at a time.
Actually that’s not quite true.
I like being cold precisely because I <em>don’t</em> like being cold.
Or rather, I like being cold because I like <em>wanting to be warm</em>.</p>

<p>A cold glass of water tastes better when you’re thirsty; a park bench more
welcoming when you’ve been walking all morning; sleep much more intoxicating
when you’re exhausted.
Everybody knows this!
And yet we act as if we don’t (and I’m no exception here).</p>

<p>One of the downsides of having most of our needs taken care of is that we forget
the importance of <em>wanting to want</em>.
That it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, for the plain and simple
reason that after too much of it the thing is no longer good.</p>
