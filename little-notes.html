<h2 id="being-wrong-and-being-surprised">Being Wrong, and Being Surprised</h2>

<p>Topics like math and computing tend to be far removed from practical every day
concerns.
But studying them requires developing a very useful practical skill: familiarity
with being convinved that you’re right, only to find out that you’re dead wrong.</p>

<h2 id="concepts-categories-and-models">Concepts, Categories, and Models</h2>

<p>All models of the world are incomplete.
Actually, models are only useful <em>because</em> they’re incomplete.
A model that perfectly reproduced every aspect of reality would be a copy of
reality.</p>

<p>We ask too much of categories!
We demand definite boundaries and firm, “yes/no” answers.
There’s tension between the simple boundary lines we can understand, and the
complex fractal-like nature of most interesting things.
Categorizing has the effect of simplifying reality in a cartoon world.
We should <em>use</em> these cartoons to their full effect, but we shouldn’t <em>believe</em>
in them.</p>

<h2 id="incentives">Incentives</h2>

<p>Only a fool is surprised when people act according to incentives.</p>
